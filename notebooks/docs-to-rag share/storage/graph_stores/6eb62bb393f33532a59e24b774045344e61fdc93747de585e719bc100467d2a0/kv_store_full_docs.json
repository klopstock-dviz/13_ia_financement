The development of the new capital will start in 2022. Although the Indonesia President commit to develop the new capital as Forest and Smart City, the surrounding area particularly the coastal area such as Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay might get high pressure as the consequence of the new development and the movement of 1.5 million people to the new capital.    Delta Mahakam, in the eastern part of East Kalimantan, is an area that is relatively close to the prospective center of the State capital (about 100 km). Mahakam Delta is naturally a mangrove habitat, but due to excessive land clearing for extensive aquaculture about 47.5 % of the mangrove ecosystem is degraded to be converted into aquaculture (2017). Despite various conservation efforts by different parties and the government, land clearing still continues. Delta Mahakam land ownership is government land that has designated as a production forest, but this area has been inhabited by residents from generation to generation.Adang Bay is one of the coastal villages in Adang Bay, Paser Regency, on the southern part of East Kalimantan Province (about 100 km from the new capital). This area is also experiencing land conversion to increase aquaculture, besides there are several locations in coastal areas that are affected by abrasion. Restoration activities in East Kalimantan Province are needed to restore a degraded environment, as well as to support the vision of the nation's capital as a green city.The ecosystem in Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay are also home to critically endangered species, such as the nasal monkey (proboscis monkey), endemic to the island of Borneo. On a global scale, the mangrove is a key ecosystem to answer the challenge of carbon sequestration and fight against climate change.The objective of the project is therefore to contribute to restore the degraded mangrove forest in East Kalimantan (Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay) as home of endemic and endangered species including proboscis monkey and key ecosystem to mitigate and to adapt the impact of climate change; and this, through four main actions: raising awareness of the stakeholders, rehabilitating degraded mangrove forest, supporting the development of sustainable livelihood, and strengthening the coastal governance. Main Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to which the project contributesMain SDG targets and indicators to which the project contributes: 12.8. By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature.13.1. Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.13.3. Improve education, awareness-raising, human, and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.14.2. Sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.14. B. Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets.15.5. Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.Project duration 3 years (March 2023 – February 2026) Budget & funding Total required resources (€) 2023-2026 818 341 € // 903 613 USD Author(s) YML, POKJA, Yayasan Planete Urgensi Indonesia, Planète Urgence Approval by partners Planète Urgence/Yayasan Planet Urgensi Indonesia Name: Réonaldus\nTitle: Indonesia National Delegate YML Name: Achmad Nuriyawan Title: Director POKJA Name: Hamsuri Title: The Board of TrusteeTable of contents"
