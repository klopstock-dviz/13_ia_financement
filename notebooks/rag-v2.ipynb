    "    for their livelihood. As a result, 54.19% of the Mahakam Delta has been\n",

    "    Largest archipelago in the world (more than 13,000 islands), Indonesia has\n",
    "    an area of 1,905,000 km2 of which less than 50% is still covered by forests\n",
    "    today, while the country is part of the 3rd largest planetary tropical\n",
    "    forest zone (after the Amazon and the Congo Basin). More than half of\n",
    "    Indonesian forests have disappeared since 1960. However, they are home to\n",
    "    a large part of the world's biodiversity (more than 10% respectively of plant,\n",
    "    mammal, reptile and bird species). Today, the country counts for 3 to 5% of\n",
    "    annual global greenhouse gas emissions (among the 10 most emitting\n",
    "    countries) including more than 50% due to land use, their change of land use\n",
    "    and the exploitation of forests.\n",
    "    Indonesia is home to almost 1/4 of the world's mangroves (20%). This\n",
    "    maritime ecosystem, made up of a set of mainly woody plants (the most\n",
    "    notable species being the mangrove), develops in the swinging area of the\n",
    "    tides of the low coasts and in marshes at the mouth of certain rivers. Of the\n",
    "    nearly 3.2 million hectares of mangrove forest 2 in the country today, more\n",
    "    than 50,000 ha are lost each year.\n",
    "    The mangrove is one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet,\n",
    "    home to a particularly abundant biomass. The mangroves' root system is\n",
    "    notably a biotope where a variety of fish and crabs live and reproduce. The\n",
    "    mangrove thus provides important resources (forestry and fishery) to coastal\n",
    "    populations, a natural “buffer” zone adapted to salinity, filtering sediment\n",

    "    an important natural fount of carbon, with Indonesian mangroves storing\n",
    "    around 5 times more carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests. The\n",

    "    In addition, the degradation of this ecosystem leads to a decrease in fish\n",
